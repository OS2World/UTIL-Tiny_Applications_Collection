                     Tiny Applications Collection

Tiny Applications Collection is a set of small programs, shell scripts
and  other things  which  may be  useful  in everyday  life of  system
administrators, users  and programmers.   They can be  also used  as a
base for a more specialised application as they are all Open Source.
If you have written utility which may be useful for others and want to
share it please email me  at mina86/AT/mina86.com, I'll be glad to add
your utility to the collection.
At the moment the collection includes:
 * cdiff -  adds ANSI codes to the output of diff making it a bit more
readable. Reads input from stdin and send colorized output to stdout;
 * cutcom - removes C++ comments  from stdin and outputs the result to
   stdout;
 * rot13 - performs an ROT13 'encryption' on stdin;
More  documentation about  each  utility is  usually  provided in  the
source code.
